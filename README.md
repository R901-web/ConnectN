# ConnectN
This is a console-based version of Connect 4 coded in C#. However, what stands out from regular Connect 4 is the ability for the user to choose the dimensions of the board, as well as how many in a row to win. 

Planned Features: 
1. Simple AI for one-player games
2. Add a loop to play multiple games in one run
3. Add a logger for each run
